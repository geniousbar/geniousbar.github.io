<p>How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don’t know. <a href="#">Oh, switch<br />

you pull both of these.</p>

<p>Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can’t get to you. I’ll get the<br />
princess out on the Falcon. But…but…but…where are you going? Uh…come<br />
back!! Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical.</p>

<p><img src="https://placekitten.com/650/300" alt="Placekitten" /></p>

<p>Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod, or you’re going to be a permanent resident! Wait!<br />
Wait!</p>

<p>Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five…to one.<br />
Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes…from time to time. Oh, dear,<br />

<p>Don’t worry about Master Luke. I’m sure he’ll be all right. He’s quite clever,<br />
you know…for a human being.</p>

<p>Luke! ==You must complete the training==. I can’t keep the vision out of my<br />
head. They’re my friends. I’ve got to help them. You must not go! But Han and<br />
Leia will die if I don’t. You don’t know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate.<br />
But I can help them! I feel the Force! But you cannot control it.</p>

<p><strong>Strong and lists</strong></p>

<p>This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of<br />
the Force. Yes, yes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>To Obi-Wan you listen.</li>
  <li>The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!</li>
  <li>But I’ve learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and<br />
finish what I’ve begun.</li>
  <li>You have my word.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are<br />
made to suffer. And that is why I have to go. Luke, I don’t want to lose you to<br />
the Emperor the way I lost Vader.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You won’t.</li>
  <li>Stopped they must be.
    <ul>
      <li>Nested list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On this depends.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>This is emphasised</em> I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of<br />
them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest… hut him up or shut him<br />
down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.<br />
But, sir! They’re getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think<br />
we’re in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive<br />
motivator has been damaged.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to go to light-speed! We’re in trouble!</p>
